We're talking about changing _everything_--not just our abilities, relationships, politics, economy, religion, biology, language, mathematics, history, or future but all of these things at once. The only single event I can see shifting pretty much everything at once is our first encounter with intelligent extraterrestrial life.

The development of any of our current capabilities--genetics, computing, language, even compassion--all feel like incremental advances in existing abilities. As we've seen before, the culmination of one branch of inquiry always just opens the door to a new branch and never yields the wholesale change of state we anticipated. Nothing we've done in the past couple of hundred thousand years has truly changed everything, so I don't see us doing anything in the future that would change everything, either.

No, the only way to change everything is for something to be done _to_ us instead. The encounter between humanity and an "other" entails a shift beyond the solipsism that has characterized our civilization since our civilization was born. It augurs a reversal as big as the encounter between an individual and its offspring or a creature and its creator. Even if this were to be the result of something we'd done, it would now be independent of us and our efforts.

To meet a neighbor, whether outer, inner, cyber-, or hyperspatial, finally turns us into an "us." To encounter an other--whether god, ghost, biological sibling, independently evolved life-form, or emergent intelligence of our own creation--changes what it means to be human.

Our computers may never inform us that they are self-aware; extraterrestrials may never broadcast a signal to our SETI dishes; interdimensional creatures may never appear to those who aren't taking psychedelics at the time--but if any of these things happened, that would change everything.
