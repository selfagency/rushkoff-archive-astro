blurb: 'As unlikely as it sounds, Rupert Murdoch may end up being our last best hope
  for a peaceful solution to the Internet''s war on professional journalism. A man
  who many blame for commodifying, globalizing, sensationalizing, and cheapening news
  is considering taking a stand against a force even bigger than himself: the Web
  link.'
