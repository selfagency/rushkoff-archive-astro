The digerati heir to Marshall McLuhan, media theorist, writer and novelist Douglas Rushkoff sprang to prominence in the mid-90s when his book Media Virus--describing how viral media works--was snapped up by marketers and advertising agencies struggling to communicate online.

Rushkoff's latest thought-provoking book, _Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now_, explains how the always-on nature of digital technology is changing our sense of time. One effect, according to Rushkoff, is narrative collapse--in an age of constant stimulation from a thousand sources all at once, no one is able to pay attention long enough for us to actually tell stories. We're moving away from the Aristotelian narrative arc of beginning, middle and end, towards the kind of open-ended play seen in video games like the hugely popular MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games) like _World of Warcraft_ or _Grand Theft Auto_.

For Rushkoff, in a cultural landscape characterised by continual feedback, the linear logic of cause and effect is being replaced by pattern recognition. Cultural literacy is increasingly about being able to learn the sequences of moves and buttons that trigger Ryu's fishing move in _Street Fighter II_, or developing the intuitive algorithms of hip references to identify next season's trends.

Here Rushkoff talks to _Pitch Magazine_ about the implications of open-ended interactive storytelling, and the future of brands in our digital world.

**How do you see the logic of video games, this idea of a story that never ends, playing out on a wider social scale?**

When you're playing video games and moving choice-to-choice-to-choice, you end up less goal-oriented, less end-oriented and much more experientially-oriented, a bit more in whatever present moment you're in. It's really good for decoupling your emotions from the grand narrative of culture. A culture that is characterised by _Game of Thrones_-like open-ended, episodic or massive-ensemble, non-protagonist kind of stories, is going to be much harder to steer. On the other hand, people who are in that choice-to-choice-to-choice presentism of a video game can be really direction-less and in some ways more easily manipulated at each turn.

**For the individual, is navigating this space about moving between different frames of reference without losing ourselves, our sense of identity?**

We're trying to do more than one thing at the same time, or we think we are. It's the idea of trying to ape the parallel processing ability of a computer chip, when you're actually an organic continuous being with only one point of focus. I wrote an article for the UK called "Which One of These Sneakers is Me." This kid was staring at a wall of sneakers and that's what he said to me. He gave me this whole thing about the different brand images and purposes. How we move from one identity to another is key for anybody in an age where you get to choose.

**What role brands can play in helping us navigate our choices?**

Well there are two things. On the one hand, if your brand is going to be mythological and invested with all these kinds of stories then it's going to be emotionally charged. Nike spent a lot of money on that. When you need motivation or an emotional connection to a symbol system, brands are good for that.

But the thing that really makes them work is if you know that behind the brand, the actual culture is doing the thing too. What used to charge a brand was the storytelling ability of the creative department of its advertising agency. That wasn't about the attributes. But now, I mean... what did an Apple ad become in the height of Apple? An Apple ad was Steve Jobs saying this is incredible, showing the thing itself.

**So what is the role of brand managers?**

It's the same thing you would tell a good press secretary of a politician. You can either be there to shield the public and the press from what's going on or if your guy is good he should be able to express what's going on. In some ways that's an anti-cynical, optimistic view. What I run into a lot is advertisers and brand managers who genuinely do not believe in what they're doing. I have way more people asking me how do I sell something I don't believe in than how do I communicate a product that I do.

**How do you think social media is going to change?**

One thing is Facebook operates under the premise that people value personal product recommendations more than ads, but once that is successfully corrupted by paying people to promote things to one another, then Facebook loses its advantage.

Now people are understanding viral media rather than viral marketing, which is important... The sort of discontinuous communication, non locational, so you do something and kids in Minnesota see it. It's different from real time, real place. It's digital in essence. But I feel like the viral thing is big. And you know, dunking the Oreo cookie in the dark, that's viral media. The Oreo Twitter campaign has really fast turnaround now, the approval process is almost instantaneous so that they can seize on events. The lights went out in a football game in New Orleans and everybody was in the dark. Oreo sent out a tweet saying you can still dunk cookies in the dark and it was hailed as brilliant. It was really being praised because recency matters more than relevancy in that space. Now every brand has a person sitting ready to tweet and get a fast approval.

They're pedal to the metal to get on the moment-to-moment thing, but that's their version of present shock. If people are only in the moment, then we have to be part of that moment, so how do we insinuate our brand into that.

**Is it about adopting a non-linear way of thinking?**

Not getting lost is the trick. With non-linear processes, try to distinguish between the paranoid drawing connections between everything that's happening, and more skilled pattern recognition. One feels like drowning and the other feels like surfing. But yes, they're both alternatives to the good old fashioned cause and effect logic. I mean, the problem is, when you live in a culture that has feedback, each effect becomes the new cause and it just starts spinning.

**Is pattern recognition like reading music in a way, different sequences happening on different levels at different rhythms, seeing a kind of composition between them?**

Even simpler than music, it's resonance. Going back to someone like McLuhan, what we're talking about is getting away from the figure and toward the ground, away from the subject and into the landscape. The landscape is where all those resonances are happening.
