Are you having a good time yet?  
a tip from Douglas Rushkoff

Chances are, if you're reading this book you will never have to worry about finding your next meal or getting a roof over your head. And if your survival needs are taken care of, then the rest is about fun. Play. Self-actualisation. Even if you decide to go to Africa to help feed the starving - for them it's survival, but for you it's fun.

No matter how terrible things are, or how little time you might have left, there's no good reason not to start having as much fun as possible, right now.

_Douglas Rushkoff adds_: Some day, you're going to die. And when you're lying there on your deathbed, you won't look back on your life and count how much you accomplished, how much money you earned or even how you'll be remembered. The only thing that will matter is how much fun you've had - how much true, deep, intimate fun. So, ask yourself: Are you having a good time yet?
