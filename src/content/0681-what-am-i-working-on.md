1\\. A new book on fun - doing things, particularly in one's profession or organization, for meaning rather than profit. Getting beyond survival as a motivation, if you're no longer truly fighting for survival - and this is made so hard in our culture.
2\\. A new Frontline documentary, tentatively entitled Consumer Democracy. We start shooting today. It's about advertising, marketing, and public relations, and how they have come to shape American democracy.
3\\. PTV3 - I'm playing keyboard in Genesis P-Orridge's newest incarnation of Psychic TV. Our first gig is in NYC on December 3. I'll find out where this weekend.
4\\. Teaching at [NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program](http://itp.nyu.edu).
5\\. Finishing my graphic novel, [Club ZeroG](http://www.rushkoff.com/clubzerog.html) with artist Steph Dumais.
6\\. Readying a slightly revised, paperback edition of [Nothing Sacred.](http://www.nothingsacred.com)
7\\. Speaking around the world - mostly at universities, but also at some synagogues and industry conferences.
8\\. Writing a columng for [The Feature](http://www.thefeature.com), a Nokia-sponsored web magazine about things wirless. I'm in a writing posse with my good friends Justin Hall, Mark Frauenfelder, and Howard Rheingold.
9\\. Beginning a disseration for a PhD from Utrecht University, about whether interactivity can allow for Huizinga's vision of a society based in play.
10\\. Working on a revised edition of Playing the Future - retitled "ScreenAgers," and with a more critical assessment than I had back in 1995 of the promise of digital media for young people.
