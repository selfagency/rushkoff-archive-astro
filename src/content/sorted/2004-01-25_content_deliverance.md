Come over to [The Feature](http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100343) and check out my new 'think piece' on the decreasing value of 'owning' digital data. I'll be participating in the discussion over there, too, which is kind of fun: most of the readers are wireless industry pros who disagree with any point of view that doesn't coordinate well with their existing business plan...

Please do feel free - and encouraged - to participate over there. I'd love for those folks to see how the 'real' interactive culture thinks about these things - and especially about their marketing ideas...
