**HACKING BORDERS:  
REVOLUTION OR RENAISSANCE?**

So often we hear people using the word _revolution_ to describe the current overwhelming cultural shift fostered by technology and new media. However overwhelming it might be, can we really describe the current transition as a revolution? For me, the word _revolution_ evokes images of a violent upheaval and guillotined heads. There's certainly very little progress implied by _revolution_; it is simply someone spinning around in circles. Digital culture may be marginally revolutionary in the sense that it is characterized by what so many companies and institutions have called "thinking outside the box"--a willingness to challenge conventions and consider meta-narratives. But this notion of thinking outside the box and gaining perspective is not simply moving in a circle. We are coming to a new understanding of what had always been considered literal reality; we are seeing it instead as a picture of reality. Our new tools are also leading us to feel empowered enough to adjust the frame around that picture. Such an upscaling of perception, intention, and design is better described as _renaissance_.

_Renaissance_ literally means "rebirth." Old ideas emerge in a new context. A renaissance is a reconfiguring of the constructed ways we experience the world in order to reconnect with it, the adaptation our cultural lenses to conform to our changing vision. In the last Renaissance, a number of discoveries and inventions changed our most basic experience of the real. Perspective painting allowed us to create representations of reality that simulated dimensionality. The discovery that the world was round and the ability to circumnavigate it radically redefined our notion of space and our sense of agency. The development of calculus allowed us to relate planes to spheres and spheres to four-dimensional fictional objects, performing conceptual calculations never before possible. The printing press allowed the widespread distribution of ideas and data, connecting people in expanded social and political communities. By the Enlightenment, coffee imported from Morocco encouraged people to stay up late at night and talk, giving rise to a "bohemian" culture dedicated to challenging conventional models of reality through the new perspectives they had gained.

The late 20th century brought discoveries and inventions whose collective impact could be considered a renaissance of at least equal magnitude. While perspective painting allowed Renaissance artists to create two-dimensional images, the holograph now allows us to create three-dimensional representations that approximate our vision even more closely. By manipulating the laws of perspective, some Renaissance painters created deliberately skewed or "trick" representations of reality, challenging the reliability of our vision and suggesting the possibility that illusion exists in reality. The mechanics of the holograph offer a similar challenge because when a holographic plate is shattered into many pieces, the image is not fragmented. Each shard of the plate will contain a smaller image of the entire original, suggesting that fractal relationships may underlie much of our illusions as well as our reality. The underlying technology of holographs further extends our understanding of dimensionality and has been used to understand everything from society to brain anatomy.

Although Renaissance explorers discovered that the world was round, modern scientists discovered atomic energy and took us to the moon. Having already mastered the globe through exploration, we were now able to explore beyond it, to see it as an object from another position in space, and even to destroy it. Meanwhile, chaos math and systems theory opened complex conceptual possibilities in much the same way calculus had for Renaissance mathematicians.

The computer and the Internet have changed communication, publication, and the idea of community to a degree comparable to the printing press. LSD and psychedelics, like the coffee beans of the Renaissance, had people staying up late together and experimenting with the status quo.

A renaissance is a shift in perspective, the shift from living within a model to moving outside of it. Or, as video gamers might express it, from _game_ to _metagame_. Young people who spend a lot of time immersed in video game environments understand this phenomenon well. There are two ways one can learn to play a game. The first is to read the rules, practice, and use old-fashioned trial and error. The second is to find the magazines and Web sites that will share secret codes to avoid traps, win levels, and gain special advantages in the game. Are the people using these "cheat sheets" really playing the game? Certainly, but the game they are playing is the meta-game.

Likewise, there are moments when we, as society, as a culture, or even as individuals, shift from simply playing the game by the rules to playing the meta-game and changing the rules. These are renaissance moments. Renaissance moments happen when we experience a shift in perspective so that the stories, models, and languages that we have been using to understand our reality are suddenly up for grabs. But these renaissance moments are transitory, because almost as soon as our perspectives are shifted, we settle into new conventions. Alas, the possibilities opened by our new perspective close up, and we once again mistake the map for the territory. We forget that the new stories and metaphors we have developed are just representations, and we mistake them for literal history.

But before things have been locked down, ideas compete for consensus. The challenge, and the opportunity, during these moments is to make a positive impact in that struggle. For me, this means preserving the notion that the ideas that win consensus approval may be useful, but they are still arbitrary. This is the true _border hack_: to move outside the frame of the picture and show others how this is possible. I would argue that we are currently in a period of renaissance, still in the process of assimilating the results of a shift in perspective caused by remarkable technological progress. We are still aware that the shift is going on and hoping to preserve some aspect of our newfound sensitivity into the next phase of human society. It is akin to the realization we have in the heightened state of awareness caused by a mystical or psychedelic experience: At the height of a visionquest we wonder how we will be able to remember that state of awe or insight once the experience is over. We wonder how to plant a seed or landmark of some kind that will be remembered after the return to waking-state consciousness.

Likewise, those of us aware of the power of the current renaissance are attempting to preserve and extend the notion that much of reality itself is "open source"--that the "codes" by which we organize our experiences are more accessible than we generally assume. For artists, cultural producers, and, of course, activists, there is an imperative to influence what will become the new consensus and to mark it with sense of possibility that will help us maintain a sense of agency over our own collective and individual perspectives.

A lucky beneficiary of the digital renaissance, I have been encouraged to believe that our reality is, indeed, open source--or at least that much of what we have been regarding as permanent _hardware_ is, indeed, only _software_ and subject to change. For me, the most important insight of cyberculture is that we all have access its codes; we are all potential reality programmers.

Media constitute the realm in which our reality is negotiated. I used to stay up nights wondering: What are media? It was a perplexing question. A zipper is a medium; open, it means one thing and closed, another. A face is a medium; we read people's appearance and expressions for information about them. Even our DNA is a medium--arguably, the best medium nature has developed, capable of sending codes through the millennia. Ultimately, only a person's most essential consciousness--one's agency, will, and intention--isn't a medium. As consciousnesses swimming in media, we create and control narratives to negotiate reality and our places within it. Through competing stories we negotiate what is going on. But by making up rules and creating tools for storytelling, we negotiate how those stories will be told: the meta-story.

Renaissances are, in part, the moments when we pull out of a particular story long enough to consider the way in which it is being told. The game and the meta-game, the stories and the meta-stories, have been regulated and controlled for centuries. As Aristotle well understood, stories work by creating a character whom the audience likes and having that character make a series of decisions that lead to terrible danger. This brings the audience into a heightened state of tension about this poor character who has made all these wrong decisions. Then, once the audience can't take it anymore, the storyteller invents a solution. In a Greek play that solution might have been Athena coming down to save the day.

This same storytelling technique has perhaps been perfected by the advertising industry, which has exploited the mainstream mediaspace for its ability to tell very influential little stories called commercials. In 28 seconds, we identify with, say, an aggravated executive, follow him into his hellish day, up the inclined plane of tension. Because we are a captive audience, with no access to the tools of storytelling, we must take that pain-relieving pill with him at the end of the commercial to relieve our anxiety. The storyteller chooses what pill the listener has to swallow at the end of the story--whether it is a new president or an old religion.

**LET THERE BE NETWORKS**

I saw a bumper sticker on a minivan in Wisconsin recently that read, "In case of rapture, this car will be empty!" I suppose that little quip means my car will still be occupied. But I am less troubled by the inevitability of my damnation, according to their schema, than the delight with which those Milwaukee passengers were anticipating Armageddon. They are looking forward to the apocalypse!

This is what happens when people take the stories their religions offer a bit too literally. Sure enough, the narratives of the Bible--like those of many other religions--tell a version of the history of the human race, from God's creation of the universe through the life and death of a messiah right on to the end of everything and the tallying of the score. If you subscribe to the right story and follow the rules, all you have to do is wait for the ending and you'll be saved. Best of all, the real quandaries of human existence--questions such as "Where do we come from?" and "Where do we go when we die?" are now a matter of preordained fate. A closed book.

But these kinds of stories were developed back before the days of interactive media. When you're part of a captive, passive audience without keyboards or even joysticks, the only way out of a story is to wait. You have to accept the storyteller's solution because it's the only one. Either that, or reject the story altogether and risk damnation.

This was the sad fate of poor infidels like me, until pretty recently. Thanks to the Internet, we now have a way out of the story: We can write our own endings.

After all, this interactive medium is, at its core, an invitation to talk back--television with a keyboard. The online world is one in which we are entitled to voice our own opinions, however much they might contradict the status quo. We are challenged to reflect on the stories we're being told, even create our own versions--our own, personal, sacred truths.

What a terrific weapon the Internet gives us against extreme fundamentalism!

And it comes just in time now that we're facing the darkest terror of true believers who blindly follow the unilateral decrees of their leaders. For fundamentalists are simply people who insist that their religion's narrative become everyone else's literal truth.

Interactive media tend to loosen up those fixed narratives by allowing users to contribute their own ideas to the story. Try giving a sermon in an AOL chat room, or a list of commandments on the Yahoo Internet Life bulletin boards. The people you're preaching to won't remain silent, at all. The clergy I know who have taken their messages online have had to reassess their roles as ministers of faith and accept new ones as partners in spiritual learning. When religion is practiced on the Internet, participants quickly realize that we're all in this together.

The Internet undermines the blind obedience of fundamentalism by offering alternative points of view, promoting pluralism, and encouraging feedback. Not that this interactivity is all that new. While the fundamentalist priests of ancient Israel sacrificed animals on the altar, those interested in hypertext were sitting around a table arguing together as they wrote the Talmud. While fundamentalist lslamists were declaring their first Holy Wars, liberals in old Baghdad were sharing wine and finding common ground with similarly inclined Christians and Jews.

Today, the Internet deconstructs the narratives that religions use to explain the world, while inviting people from every race and culture to participate in the conversation. No wonder fundamentalists are getting upset.

In this light, it's easy to see the entire personal computing revolution as a new sort of spiritual movement. Is it coincidental that these technologies were developed in California's Bay Area, the breeding ground for alternative spiritual practices? Even the first easily networkable personal computer--the Apple--was conceived by Steve Jobs on the bongwater-stained carpets of a Reed College dorm room. And Jobs, a Buddhist at the time, didn't call it an Apple for nothing. The personal computer was the forbidden fruit--a way of access to the Tree of Knowledge, and an affront to those who would sequester any information from the formerly little people. The meek would indeed inherit the earth.

The realms of computing and, even more so, networking were unfamiliar turf. They were hard to navigate and harder still to design. People were creating a universe now, and it was as challenging as a lucid dream: Anything we could imagine, we would behold. It's no wonder that many Silicon Valley firms were forced to rely on the skills of many wild young members of the counterculture, people whose own mystical excursions had brought them into intimate contact with realities as mutable and hallucinatory as any graphical user interface.

Those of us lucky enough to get online in the early years were immediately struck by how plastic, fluid, and malleable the world can be. Onlme communities have no real form--they are the ever-changing consensus reality of their members. One's value in an interactive conversation is not his or her ability to obey, but the capacity to hear and then express. The interactive universe does not exist without the active participation of its people--and this participation is the ongoing act of creation itself. Talk about playing God.

**THE END OF THE OLD STORY**

Interactivity changed our relationship to other media, too. It was hard to watch television in quite the same way, especially with a remote control in your hand. Whether we simply channel-surfed away from the surfers on _Baywatch_, or went online and posted alternatives to a CNN story, our interactive tools gave us the ability to deconstruct the stories we were being told, and to begin to construct our own.

This is actually something very rare, especially in the spiritual realm.

There are a few faiths in which congrcgants are invited to participate in the creation and interpretation of the underlying narrative. Certain Jewish sects spurn answers in favor of more questions and interpretation; Quakers enjoy a dogma-free, town-meeting style Sabbath. Most religious traditions, however, simply treat their believers as a "mass," who must depend on their priests or ministers for access to the "story." But just as the Internet has led patients to information about alternative medical treatments (often against doctor's orders), it has given congregants the ability to find alternative stories about who we are, who made us, and why.

More important than any one story we may have discovered or written, the experience of sifting through them all, taking them apart, and writing our own has changed our relationship to religion, perhaps forever. The Internet is anathema to narrative. If you want to understand life as a story etched in stone, you had better stay away.

Cyber culture, based on an ethic of interactivity, releases the captive audience from the spell of the story and offers them the opportunity for active participation, instead.

The television remote control represented the first in a series of liberating interactive technologies. Imagine a man sitting in his LaZBoy chair in 1958, with popcorn on his lap, watching a painful commercial. The TV programmer is dead-set on throwing this poor man into a terrible state of anxiety. If the viewer wants to get out of that imposed state of tension, he's got to move the popcorn off his lap, lift himself out of his chair, walk up to the TV, and turn the channel--which is, perhaps, 50 calories of human labor. If he sits through to the end of the commercial, however, he may use up only 10 calories of anxiety. The brain is lazy; it makes the lazy decision. It will take the 10 calories and submit to the programming. After all, the material on TV is called programming for a reason; it's designed to program us as we sit passively in our seat. But the remote control changes the equation. Imagine a 14-year-old today, watching a commercial, and feeling the first signs that he's being put into an imposed state of tension. With the .0001 calorie that it takes to press a button, he's out of tension and out of the arc of that story. Kids with a remote control watch TV in a new way, following 10 stations at once, surfing back and forth through different stories. When they experience TV like this they're not watching television at all, but watching the television, deconstructing it as television.

The second liberating interactive device was the videogame joystick. For most of you, your inaugurating videogame experience was Pong. And, perhaps amazingly, you probably still remember that first moment you played. Pong was a simple game based on ping-pong, with two white squares on either side of the screen that would move up and down along with your movements on a control knob. People remember their first time playing Pong the way they remember where they were when President Kennedy was shot. This isn't because Americans loved table tennis so much and were happy to have the convenience of practicing it on TV. It wasn't about the literal meaning of the metaphor; it was about experiencing something on the television as metaphor. It was a thrill just to move the little white square up and down on the screen, to control the pixel. We had never had control of the pixel before. The TV screen was the holy and inaccessible realm of newscasters and movie stars, a magical place where things simply appeared. But just as the remote control deconstructed television's stories, so the joystick demystified its technology--making it an accessible medium and rendering it safe.

Finally, the computer mouse and the keyboard liberated the receive-only monitor, and turned it into a portal through which we could express ourselves. The mouse and keyboard spawned a do-it-yourself (DIY) Internet culture in which people created, uploaded, and shared their own content. In a sense, people were the content; we used technology to connect with other people.

The resulting cyberpunk culture was a renaissance culture. It was a chaotic space, where new ideas could spring up from almost anywhere. It was a gift economy, where new programs were created and shared--for free. It was a community, where new members were introduced and escorted around as if they had just bought a home in a fantasy suburb. Best of all, Internet users came to understand that the mainstream mediaspace no longer represented their reality. From now on, Internet users would represent their own.

In those days--the 2400-baud, ASCII-text era of ten long years ago--the Internet had nothing to do with the NASDAQ index. In fact, until 1992 you had to sign an agreement promising not to conduct any business online just to get access to the Internet! Imagine that. It was a business-free zone.

How could such rules have ever been put in place? Because the Internet began as a public project. It was created to allow scientists at universities and government facilities to share research and computing resources. Everyone from the Pentagon to Al Gore saw the value of universally accessible information-sharing network, and invested all sorts of federal funds in building a backbone capable of connecting computers around the world.

What they didn't realize was that they were doing a whole lot more than connecting computers to one another. They were connecting people to one another, too. Before long, all those scientists who were supposed to be exchanging research or comparing data were also exchanging stories about their families and comparing notes on the latest _Star Trek_ movies. People from around the world were playing games, socializing, and crossing cultural boundaries that had never been crossed before. Because no one was using it to discuss military technology anymore, the government abandoned the network and turned it over to the public.

The Internet's unexpected social side-effect turned out to be its incontrovertible main feature. Its other functions fall by the wayside. The Internet's ability to network human beings is its very life's blood. It fosters communication, collaboration, sharing, helpfulness, and community. Then word got out.

The nerdiest among us found out first. Then came those of us whose friends were nerds. Then their friends, and so on. Someone would simply insist he had found something you needed to know about--the way a childhood friend lets you in on a secret door leading down to the basement under the junior high school.

How many of you can remember that first time you watched him log on? How he turned the keyboard over to you and asked what you want to know, where you want to visit, or whom you want to meet? That was the magic moment when you "got it." Internet fever. There was a whole new world out there, unlimited by the constraints of time and space, appearance and prejudice, gender and power.

It's no wonder so many people compared the 1990s Internet to the psychedelic 1960s. It seemed that all we needed to do was get a person online and he or she would be changed forever. And people were. A sixty-year-old midwestern businessman I know found himself logging on every night to engage in a conversation about }ungian archetypes. It lasted for four weeks before he even realized the person with whom he was conversing was a sixteen-year-old boy from Tokyo.

It felt as though we were wiring up a global brain. Visionaries of the period, like Ted Nelson, invented words like _hypertext_ and told us how the Internet could be used as a library for everything ever written. A musician named Jaron Lanier invented a bizarre interactive space he called "virtual reality," in which people would be able to, in his words, "really see what the other means." Starry-eyed authors like me wrote optimistic books announcing the new global renaissance.

The Internet was no longer a government research project. It was alive. Out of control and delightfully chaotic. What's more, it promoted an agenda all its own.

Using a computer mouse and keyboard to access other human beings on the other side of the monitor changed our relationship to media and the power they held. The tube was no longer a place that only a corporate conglomerate could access. It was Rupert Murdoch, Dan Rather, and Heather Locklear's turf no more. The Internet was _our_ space.

The Internet fostered a DIY mentality. We called 1t _cyberpunk_. Why watch packaged programming on TV when you can make your own online? Who needs corporate content when you can be the content? This was a whole new world we could design ourselve, on our own terms. It felt like a revolution.

That's why it fostered such a deep sense of community. New users were gently escorted around the Internet by more seasone veterans and shown where and how to participate. An experienced user would delight in setting up a newbie's Internet connection. It was considered an honor to rush out into the night to fix a fellow user's technical problem. To be an Internet user was to be an Internet advocate.

It's also why almost everything to do with the Internet was free. Software was designed by people who wanted to make the Internet a better place. Hackers stayed up late making new programs and then distributed them free of charge to anyone who cared to use them.

All the programs we use today are actually based on this shareware and freeware. _Internet Explorer_ and _Netscape_ are just fat versions of a program called _Mosaic_, created at the University of Illinois. Streaming media technology is really just dolled up version of _CUSeeMe_, a program developed at Cornell. The Internet was built for love, not profit.

And that was the problem--for business, anyway. At the time almost no one was making money on the Internet. Not that this bothered any of the Internet's actual users, but the effects of the remote control, the mouse, and the joystick had to be undone. As more and more people got online, they spent less and less time consuming elevision programs and commercials. Studies showed that families with Internet connections were watching 3 or 4 hours less TV a week, seeing fewer commercials, and buying fewer TV-advertised products. Furthermore, peopie who are having fun and feeling connected to other people are less easily coerced into purchases Something had to be done.

**WHOSE STORY IS IT, ANYWAY?**

Thus began the long march to turn the Internet into a profitable enterprise. It started with content. Dozens, then hundreds of online magazines sprang up. But because the Internet had always been free, no one wanted to pay a subscription charge for content. It just wasn't something one did online. So most of the magazines went out of business.

The others, well, they invented the next great Internet catastrophe: the banner ad. Web publishers figured they could sell a little strip on top of each web page to an advertiser, who'd use it as a billboard for commercials. But everyone hated them. They got in the way. It was like scuba diving with someone putting bumper stickers over your mask. And the better we got at ignoring banner ads, the more distractingly busy they grew and the more time-consuming they were to download. They only taught us to resent whichever advertiser was inhibiting our movement.

So advertising gave way to e-commerce. First, the mediaspace deconstructed by the remote control had to be put back together. People doing what comes naturally online, like typing messages to one another, don't generate revenue. The object of the game, for Internet business, was to get people's hands off the keyboard and onto the mouse. Less collaboration, more consumption. Companies developed concepts such as _stickiness_, _attention economy_, and _eyeball hours_ in an effort to keep people glued to Web sites as they were once glued to TV stations. In response to panicked articles from the mainstream media about a channel-surfing culture and decreasing attention spans, attention deficit disorder diagnoses and Ritalin prescriptions rose over 100%. Children's ability to enact renaissance was curtailed through drugs.

In order to regain control of the pixel, which the joystick had liberated, professional designers re-mystified the computer's interface so that it was no longer two-way. Users were forced to rely on the "wizards" built into their software programs to work magic they didn't understand. Consider the increasing opacity of the interface from DOS to the Macintosh to Windows2000. Look at the colorful and confusing interfaces used on the World Wide Web compared with the text-only bulletin boards of the early Internet. And "information architecture" turned into the science of getting people to click on the "buy" button. The only way to participate on the Web is through the mouse; the only opportunity to use the keyboard is to enter one's credit card information (if it's not already on a cookie, somewhere deep on our hard drive). The increasing and deliberate opacity of new interfaces is designed to keep us out.

Finally, in order to undo the DIY culture that had grown out of the keyboard and the mouse, commerce replaced community and content replaced people as the soul of the Net. It was announced that we were in an "Information Age" rather than a "Communication Age" because information can be bought and sold as a commodity.

Anyone logging onto the Internet for the first time in the year 2000 encountered a very different Internet than the interactive playground of ten years earlier. Browsers and search engines alike were designed to keep users either buying products or consuming commercial content. Most of those helpful hackers were now vested employees of dot.com companies. And most visions of the electronic future had dollar signs before them.

In the interests of the investment community, the Internet was restyled as an online mall. A direct marketing platform. An interactive mail-order catalog! This little scheme seemed to hold more promise. So much prormse, in fact, that Wall Street investors took notice. Not that many of these e-commerce businesses actually made money. But they looked like someday they could.

Besides, Wall Street cares less about actual revenues than the ability to create the perception that there might be revenues at some point in the future. That's why it's called speculation. Others might call it a pyramid scheme. Here's how it works: Someone writes a business plan for a new kind of e-commerce company. That person finds "angel investors"--very in-the-know people who give money to write a bigger business plan and hire a CEO. Then comes the "first round" and "second round," where other, slightly less in-the-know people invest a few million more. Then come the institutional investors, who underwrite the now-infamous Initial Price Offering (IPO) on NASDAQ. This final ground level is called "going public." At the very bottom of the pyramid, come retail investors. That's you and me. We're supposed to log into an e-trading site and invest our money. So what's all that got to do with the Internet, you ask? Exactly. The Internet was merely the sexy word, the come-hither, the bright idea at the top of the pyramid. Sure, there were and are still plenty of entrepreneurs creating vibrant, successful online businesses--look at Yahoo, Amazon, and Ebay. But the Internet wasn't born to support the kind of global economic boom that venture capitalists were envisioning. And by turning the Internet's principle use from socializing toward monetizing, business went against the Internet's very functionality.

No longer able to deconstruct, demystify, or develop our own media, we succumbed to an entirely new story about the promise new media: money. Of course, by the time the general public was buying shares online, the people at the top of the pyramid disappeared--taking away their money as the pyramid collapsed beneath them in what is called an "exit strategy." That's another way of saying "carpet bag."

**IT'S ALIVE**

The real Internet was hiding underneath this investment charade the whole time. It was a little harder to find, perhaps, and no one in the mainstream press was writing about it anymore, but plenty of people were still sharing stories, e-mailing relatives, finding new communities, and educating themselves. The spirit of the Internet was dormant, maybe, but very much alive.

This is why those schemes were doomed to fail. The behavior control being implemented by more nefarious online merchants, the mercenary tactics of former hackers, and the commercial priorities of the Internet's investors were blatant contradictions of the Internet's true nature. Sure, the Internet could support some business guests the way that a tree can support some mushrooms at its base and a few squirrels in its branches. But businesses attacked the Internet like a set of chainsaws. Or, better, a parasitic fungus. It needed to be rejected.

The dot.com pyramid schemes eventually failed because all pyramid schemes eventually run out of money. The dot.com collapse was also aided, in part, by the Internet's own structure and function. Its organic and interactive make-up shrugs off interventionist government controls. Just a bit more effort halted the corporate attacks that followed. It's no different than when the government abandoned the Internet in the 1980s. Instead of talking about defense contracts, the scientists online began talking about science fiction stories. The Internet never does what it's supposed to do. It has a mind, and life, of its own.

Now that the dot.com pyramid has failed to establish itself as the overarching metaphor of the Digital Age, digital reality--and perhaps our social reality--is once again up for grabs. That's because we're alive, too.

The many great applications that real people and organizations have developed to make all of our lives better are taking center stage. They are compelling and surpass even some of our wildest dreams for what the Internet might someday achieve. The ideas, information, and applications now launching on Web sites around the world capitalize on the transparency, usability, and accessibility that the Internet was born to deliver.

As long as we can maintain our renaissance sensibility and our awareness of the implications of the open source reality in which we live, we have access to enormous opportunities for cultural progress. These opportunities imply profound consequences for any of us who have become conscious of how to hack the borders of reality.

People who have been exposed to the Internet and to other interactive and virtual systems understand that our world--any system--is made up of intentionally designed interfaces. Spending so much time in virtual space, we are more aware of real space, political space, and ideological space, and the way it shapes interaction. We are more sensitive to the power and the way it is exploited. Right now, as a result of our renaissance sensibility, the definitions and conventions of our reality are becoming the component parts of a new language. Nothing is only itself, because its identifying characteristics become a self-conscious manifestation of its underlying essence. An ironic distance. A self-conscious reframing of almost everything.

Renaissance awareness is a form of self-protection, really. A defense. We are trying to focus on the mediated feeling of things. We want to stay awake in renaissance awareness as long as possible before the next reality template concretizes itself and self-conscious similes become tight metaphors. We now see that this is like that, sort of like that--it is as if. But we know that eventually "it is like" and "it is as if" will collapse into "it is." The world is that. Reality's transparency and accessibility lost yet again. At the same time, however, there is great longing to let go, to trust t?at the world is not trying to do something to us--to engage in an experience without fear and suspicion. Artists and writers have been working on this problem for centuries. Shakespeare often wrote prologues for his plays in which a character lets the audience in on the metaphor: "oh pardon gentles all, that we would presume that the stage would represent..." The modesty and honesty give your audience permission to relax. They know they are not going to be manipulated. If we can communicate this sort of goodwill in ritualized contexts, we should be able to do it in the real world of communication, as well. xxx

It is the responsibility of programmers and designers, in particular, to realize that genuine social engagement and genuine discourse are what will keep people out of the traps and trances they are now at pains to avoid. If we can create online and mediated experiences that foster this kind of interaction and discourse--experiences that facilitate people as people, rather than subjugating them to other intentions--we will prolong our sense of freedom as well as our ability to hack even more of world's imaginary borders.

more \~ive, more _participatory, and more, well, "Internety" than ever before. No;

s\~umping or w\~rung, slowing up or winding down. This might sound surprising,

given ?1e headlmes on most newspapers' business pages these days, which have

procl\~med the technology bubble officially burst. Likewise, analysts on the

financial cable channels and the venture capitalists of Silicon Alley now shun any

company whose name ends in .com, and have moved on to more promising new

buzzwords like "wireless."

But the metrics fly in the face of conventional wisdom. Internet use is up in

terms of real hours spent online and the number of people getting new accounts

failure to meet their investors' demands, e-commerce is actually up, as well-more

than 30% up from 2001. More than 100 million Americans now buy goods and

services online.

The Internet is more capable now than it ever was of supporting the vast range

of individual, community, and commercial interests that hope to exploit the mas-

sive power of networking. Still, countless investors, analysts, and pundits have

fallen off the Internet bandwagon.

I say good riddance. The experts jumping ship today can't see the Internet as

anything other than an investment opportunity that has dried up. Sure, the

Internet made a lot of people money, but its real promise has always been much

greater than a few upward stock ticks. If we can look past the size of our 401 K

plans to the underlying strength of our fledgling networked society, all signs are

a-okay. The Internet has never been in better health.

Maybe this kind of optimism requires us to look at the Internet as less of an

investment opportunity than a new kind of life form. Take MIT's newly

announced web curriculum. The university has promised that, over the next ten
